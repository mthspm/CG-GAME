## **PROJECT NOT COMPLETE**
Project freezed, maybe one day i'll come back to work on it, its complexity was far beyond the knowledge i had at the time rofl.

## Description
The Card Game is a game initially based on Hearthstone/Yugioh to model its logic, but in its visual and algorithmic elements it has followed its own path of authenticity. The game runs only in multiplayer and depends on a server running to accept user connections in a login/registration access control system and managing the events of matches that are running in the game.

The main inspiration for the project is to learn and develop more programming skills.

## Installation
To install the Card Game, you will need Python 3. You can download the latest version of Python from the [Python official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) here.
During the alpha phase, the game server is hosted on a local network using Hamachi for testing purposes. Make sure you have Hamachi installed and connected to the network [Hamachi official website](https://vpn.net/) here.

### Installation Step-by-Step

1. Ensure that you have Python 3 installed on your computer. If you do not already have Python 3 installed, you can download it from the official website [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project folder.

```bash
cd folder_path
```
3. On the path folder run the code to clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository-name>.git 
```

4. Run the following command to install the project dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To start playing the Card Game, simply run the main.py file in your Python environment. **Note that during the testing phase, the setup of the scripts may be scrambled. If you encounter any issues, please refer to the README file for troubleshooting steps, or contact the developer for assistance.

You are almost there!

1. Navigate to the directory of the Card Game in your command prompt.
